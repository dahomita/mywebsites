## Code-Boxer Website

The Code-Boxer website was created during my high school years when I was passionate about both coding and boxing. I learned HTML and CSS through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and I highly recommend this web to anyone looking to grasp the basics of HTML5 and CSS. The instruction is clear and comprehensive, and the hands-on projects really enhance the learning experience.

In this branch, you'll find my HTML and CSS source code. Feel free to take a look! You can paste this code into your console (like VSCode) to see the results.

Looking forward to more of my projects!!
